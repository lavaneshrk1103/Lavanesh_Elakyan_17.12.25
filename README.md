#  Flappy Bird – Python Turtle Game

##  Project Description
This project is a simple 2D arcade-style **Flappy Bird game** developed using **Python Turtle Graphics**.  
The game simulates gravity-based motion where the bird continuously falls downward, and the player controls its upward movement using keyboard input. The objective is to guide the bird safely through moving pipes with narrow gaps while avoiding collisions.

Instead of using external image files, the bird is creatively designed using **basic geometric shapes** such as a circle (body), triangle (beak), and an ellipse-like wing. This ensures better compatibility and demonstrates effective use of Turtle Graphics.

##  Features
- Gravity-based bird movement  
- Keyboard-controlled flapping (SPACE key)  
- Moving pipe obstacles with narrow gaps  
- Collision detection (pipes, ground, sky)  
- Real-time score tracking  
- Animated background clouds  
- Game-over message and restart option  

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Turtle Graphics**
- Basic programming concepts (loops, functions, conditionals, event handling)

---

## ⌨️ Controls
- **SPACE** → Make the bird flap upward  
- **R** → Restart the game after Game Over
